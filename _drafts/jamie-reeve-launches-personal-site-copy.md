Cue fanfare.

So I finally got around to putting a little personal website together. Mainly because I heard aboutÂ [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) and thought they sounded pretty neat.

It turns out it was a lot easier than I thought to get set up as well. Boom.

I may well never post on here again, so let's just take a moment to enjoy the quiet.
